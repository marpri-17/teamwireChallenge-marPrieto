This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Wishes List

Project Requeriments:
- Text box and button to add a new wish
- Show all wishes saved by the user
- Use Material UI & React

Extra features:
- Delete wish from list
- Verification of empty text field or existing item
- Save wishes in LocalStorage for recover data at each user visit
- Responsive (Mobile First)

### Development

Using by the first time Material-UI was an amazing experience. I really enjoyed learning about it, but I wouldn't be able to finish the details of layout. I focused at data gestion and made the APP functional for the final user. The exercise required about 12 hours of development, including documentation consultation.
